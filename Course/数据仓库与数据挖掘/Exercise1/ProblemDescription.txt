Hello,

Create a pseudo-random text generator in python. You can choose the implementation algorithm you find to be most appropriate. Note that you can implement this according to a Markov model of order k = 3 by building a Markov chain from a piece of text.

2- Deliverables:
Answer to this email with:
a-Your solution in python, named TextGenerator.py
b-The text you used for testing, input.txt
c-A sample of your output text, output.txt

3-Notes:
-The top header of your TextGenerator.py should have a comment that explains your algorithm
-Your code should be commented in English
